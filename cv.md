### <font color = #696969>Research Projects</font>
#### pNovo
- **Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2018 - 2020**
- We develop pNovo as a high-precision protein *de novo* sequencing tool. We implement novel index method to rapidly retrive ions and develop optimized connection graph algorithm. We also intruduce theoretical spectrum simulation as part of scoring factors and use RankingSVM to match spectrum and sequences. 
#### SmartSAN
- **Dian group, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2014 - 2015**
- SmartSAN is a commercial project jointly developed by HUST and H3C. We implement the iSCSI protocol on H3C's switches as basic protocol of storage area network.
